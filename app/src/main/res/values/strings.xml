        I love the Android platform. The platform is very flexible from
        OS to app development aspects, and many people love
        customizing their phone to show their personality. Because
        Android is open-sourced, many phone manufacturers appeal
        their own form-factor and customized OS theme. In order
        to accommodate this, Android has a concept of Fragmentation to
        support multiple screen sizes . However, this is somewhat painful
        when it comes to design image resources. If the image has a wrong
        DPI, then the image looks blurred, too pixelated, or small-scaled
         DPI categories.></string>
